# x86-cellsdk-install
A super simple script to automate install of Cell CPU cross development tools on a modern x86_64 Fedora system. The original Cell/B.E. SDKs were packaged as RPM files and organized into yum (dnf) repos easily installable on any Fedora/RHEL Linux distribution back in 2009 or therabouts. Many (most) of these packages are still compatible/installable in modern Fedora if only the yum (dnf) repos were still being hosted somewhere by someone on this planet...
### MODEL CITIZEN TO THE RESCUE
I'm hosting these repos now on my own Playstation 3 web server (running ppc Fedora) at http://www.ps3linux.net/cellsdk-repos. This script will connect your Fedora to my repos and download/install all components of the SDK that still work in modern Fedora, including the GNU PPU/SPU cross-compiling toolchains. The toolchains are old (based on gcc 4.1.1) but they are functional, fully-featured, and ready to compile Cell code right now. Your other option would be to build the PPU/SPU toolchains yourself, which is doable... if you enjoy torture. Documentation on building cross toolchains is maddeningly sparse, and documentation on building cross tools for the Cell CPU is basically non-esistant.
### 06-29-2024 - Tested (successfully) on Fedora 40 (x86_64) Server Edition
To use, simply clone this repo, enter the x86-cellsdk-install directory, and run the script "x86-cellsdk-install.sh" as root. Most files will be installed under your /opt directory. Happy SPUing!
